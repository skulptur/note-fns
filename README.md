## About

Use this library when you need a comprehensive but lightweight solution for working with musical notes. It re-exports most of the music-fns library and adds some more on top.

## Get started

Install

```bash
npm install --save note-fns
# or
yarn add note-fns
```

Use

```typescript
import { getNote } from 'note-fns'

console.log(getNote('A#4')) // 'A#'
```
